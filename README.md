## Purpose

This website is intended to represent me and develop my reputation in the tech industry in the long term.

## Functionality / features

My portfolio website is a one-page scrolling website with the following features:

- Pictures of me looking friendly
- Short bio which introduces my interests, both professional and personal, and invites people to get in touch
- Skills list, including all the technologies covered by the end of the CA course
- Portfolio with links to projects completed during the course
- Blog page with a link to the tech-related blog I run with co-author King, as well as links to several articles on the blog written solely by me
- Contact form for through which people can reach me, which emails their information to me

## Target Audience

The usual audience for a professional profile is employers and recruiters. Knowing that I have a job at MYOB directly after the CA course impacted my design decisions and encouraged me to think longer-term.

# Design Process
## Inspiration

Begun by gathering together images I liked on Pinterest. I'm into maths and nature, so focussed on these areas looking for common themes.

Also spent time looking at websites with 'design eyes' on. What did I like about the websites I use every day? How were they fit for purpose? How were they not? And what have other developers used for their portfolios?

**Pre-work**

Before receiving the assignment information on Canvas, we knew we were creating a personal portfolio website. Knowing that I'm fairly confident with code but far less confident with design, I spent my time on populating a Pinterest board with images that I felt connected to and investigating what other developers had done for their websites. There are also awards for well-designed websites, so I looked at websites that had recently won in order to see what was possible.

**Monday**

Worked on content - biography, skills, portfolio, blog and pictures.

**Tuesday**

Finalise design and colour choices and finish wireframing in Figma. Set up project resources (e.g. GitHub, Trello, README, file system as described in Canvas).

**Wednesday**

Get final approval for website design. Begin coding with plain HTML, focussing on using appropriate tags for content to make the site accessible to scree readers. Set up Netlify deployment.

**Thursday**

Finish coding the static webpage.

**Friday**

Play with CSS animation.
