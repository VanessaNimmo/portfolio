developer - combination of creativity and logic, broad industry with opportunities for continual learning and plenty to feed ones curiosity. Coding is a powerful skill that allows you to create in new and exciting ways and make the most of emerging technologies.

Spent a year self-teaching and attending MeetUps and conferences before discovering the MYOB Developher Program and being awarded a scholarship to study at Bootcamp. Each new piece of coding learning confirms that this is an area I can really get into and enjoy. There is so much to learn and discover, and coding can take you from a simple website to promote a friend's artworks, to generating art from code, to building games to help people learn a new language. Who knows where you'll end up? 

Curiosity - I've always wanted to know - forever looking up words I didn't understand or asking my parents to explain how things worked. Always an active person, when I broke my foot just before the school holidays when I was 10 I immediately turned to Mum and asked what I could learn in the break - so learnt to sew. Each day I look to expand my knowledge and skill just a little bit.
