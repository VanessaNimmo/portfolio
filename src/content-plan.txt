About
  Hi! I'm a Protege Developer at MYOB. My pre-tech background is music (for info on that check out vanessnimmo.com), with a bit of prior study in physics and maths. I'm always excited to work on a complex algorithm or read about the latest developments in quantum computing.

  I got into tech to build software that makes a difference in people's lives, and to work with awesome people. In my spare time I do vintage dance and hike in the mountains. Drop me a line to talk about any of the above!

Portfolio - have this lower down at the moment as there isn't much to put in, but could put it higher up later.
